# 1. Operating Environment

1.1 The software shall be used in an artificial looking golf room with cameras employed at different angles.

1.2 The software shall be used on any kind of operating system and version smoothly. 

1.3 The system shall need to collaborate with a photo album in order to gather pictures of ideal golf players and then start
matching. 

1.4 The system shall be integrated software which are integrated with all the components of
the system.

# 2. Design Constraints

2.1 The number of cameras in this system shall be reduced from 6 or 7 to 2 or 3 as a primary limitation
in its development, which will provide significant challenges for the system's creators. 

2.2 The fact that the system is collecting images of players is another significant constraint, and developers shall
ensure that all security precautions are followed to prevent any leaking of user data. 

2.3 In addition, the software development team shall provide a user interface in more than one language in order
to accommodate people who do not speak English. 

2.4 The system shall be efficient enough to respond to the user and coach in 5 to 6 minutes. 

2.5 The system shall dp parallel operation in processing camera and mat information to generate the report.

# 3. Language Requirements

3.1 Python shall be used for this AI software, as no specific language was constrained by
stakeholder.

# 4. Assumptions and Dependencies

4.1 As the software matches the pictures of golf players with ideal cases, if the height and weight of a
new golf player does not match with an ideal golf player then it will affect one of the requirements.

4.2 The software surely depends on the number of cameras and the angles at which they are
placed and also the weight sensor or weight mats.
